Drone vision hovering Project
===============================
Code meant to be run on Dronesmith Luci to test drone hovering algorithms. 
Previously Prof. Jianxinliu and I worked on this drone vision hovering project. This work has been published on ICUAS 2016 with tests on 3DR DIY platform. Now I am trying to move this work to Dronesmith platform and do more tests indoors. Hopefully, we can get those tests done before the deadline (the end of August,2016) of the special issue in JINT.

Thank the project of ardupilot-balloon-finder
